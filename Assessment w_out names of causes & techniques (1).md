Elijah, 

Here’s a KEY so you understand my assessment. These \[brackets\] mean I’m talking to you or what to give AI. This \[color in brackets lets you know we’re on another page\]. These \[Engaging Questions\] help you quickly find my questions. These parentheses (represent a button saying, “Next Page”).

**Scientists Just Proved Chronic Pain Lives Inside Your Cells—And We Can Now Fix It**

**What if your chronic pain isn't a "pain management" problem... but a cellular repair problem?**

Breakthrough peer-reviewed research has just confirmed what we've been seeing in our clinic for years: chronic pain is literally stored inside your cells as damaged genetic material—and it can be repaired.

**Here's the science most doctors don't know about:**

When you get injured, three types of damage occur simultaneously:

\[3 boxes \- one box for Tissues/bone damage. One for New cellular damage. One for Prenatal Cellular damage\]

1. **Tissue/bone damage** (doctors treat this—it heals in 6 months)  
2. **New cellular damage** (doctors don't treat this—it doesn't heal on its own)  
3. **Prenatal cellular damage** that gets activated by your injury (doctors don't even know this exists)

During your assessment, you will learn how chronic pain can live inside your cells and how non-invasive cellular repair works to fix it.

Most importantly, by the end of your assessment, you will know if you’re a likely candidate for our process and what to do next to move forward.

**Warning\!** Much of what you’ve been told about your chronic pain is probably an incomplete picture. This new research represents a significant breakthrough that has changed how we scientists understand chronic pain.

Most of what you read today will be entirely new to you. As such, you can request these peer-reviewed studies to review for yourself following your assessment.

This helps us determine if your chronic pain could be correlated to cellular damage.

\[I like that these 2 sentences below are in a box:\]

\[Engaging Question:\] “Have you had chronic pain for 6+ months? Yes or No

This helps us determine if your chronic pain could be correlated to cellular damage.

\[When they click “Yes” or “No”, it takes them to the next page\]

\[Somewhere on this page, show an AI picture of an area of the human body with a torn muscle & broken bone… and little dots with two different colors, one representing New cellular damage, and the other representing Prenatal cellular damage (dots) along the muscle tear and broken bone site. The dots closest to the tear & break in the bone are the New cellular damage, and just outside those dots are Prenatal cellular damage dots in another color. And another picture of the same area with healed muscle & bone & all dots remains active, representing both types of cellular damage – ideally dots are pulsing pain. This will give prospects a before and after tissue/bone damage is repaired, but cellular damage is still active, causing their current pain.\]

\[If they click “no,” the next page says, “If you’d like to be put on our waiting list, we can contact you once your chronic pain has been bothering you for a total of 6 months. Please let us know below when it will be 6 months since your injury or surgery, and give us your name, email address, and number, and we’ll text you and let you know we emailed you with a link to this assessment. Thank you.”

\[page 2\]

Recent studies published in a major scientific journal prove that bodily memories from injuries are stored in RNA inside cells.

But here's what's revolutionary: scientists discovered these damaged cellular memories are stored in your "Primary Cell"—a master template cell that controls every other cell in your body.

While your regular body cells die and regenerate every few months, your Primary Cell remains constant throughout your entire life.

This is why your chronic pain persists even as your body's tissues regenerate—because the cellular damage in your Primary Cell keeps creating new damaged cells that match the original injury pattern.

Next, let’s determine if your chronic pain type can be related to Primary Cell damage or something else…

\[Engaging Question:\] What chronic pain conditions do you suffer from?  
 (Please check all the boxes that apply over the next 2 pages.)

\[List “Here’s Who We Can Help” from my site, followed by “Here’s Who We Can NOT Help” – Wellnessinweeks.com\]

\[Add an empty field at the end of “Here’s Who We Can NOT Help”. Say, “List any conditions we missed: \[Empty field\]”

\[If the prospect has ONLY checked off a box in the “cannot help list,” this is a good time to stop their process. This page would say, “We are sorry. We cannot help this condition. Unfortunately, many chronic pain conditions are associated with diseases and infections caused by pathogens that are beyond our reach”. Don’t let them move on.\]

\[If people haven’t checked off an ailment/condition or put one in the empty field, they’re not allowed to pass. We need something to evaluate. If people have not checked any boxes but fill in the empty field, let them continue. We’ll have to inform them that a practitioner will need to review and determine if what they put in the empty field is related to Primary Cell damage. On the Pain Profile, we can inform them that if they provide us with their contact info later in the assessment, we will contact them and let them know if they are a good candidate for our process. And we can show them the rest of their Pain Profile results.\]  

\[Those I can help will click one of the boxes on the first page. These people we want to move forward in the process to the next page.\]

If you have landed on this page, it’s good news. It means you’re headed in the right direction.

Roughly half of the selections you saw are chronic pain related to disease or pathogens, conditions we cannot remedy.

\[**name of their condition**\] and \[**name of their condition**\] are good candidates for effectively repairing Primary Cell damage.

However, we’re not out of the woods...

Below is a list of physical pain sensations associated with cellular damage.

\[Engaging Question:\] What physical sensation(s) are associated with your \[**name of condition**\] & \[**name of condition**\]?

Please, check the boxes that apply:

Sharp or stabbing or shooting pain – feels like a knife, needle, or electric jolt

Burning pain – feels hot, fiery, or like being scalded

Pain that radiates down your arm/leg or across your body

Persistent dull aching pain – feels like a deep, constant soreness or heaviness that just doesn’t go away

Tingling or numbness (“pins-and-needles”) or loss of feeling

Muscle tightness or spasms or cramps – constant or sudden, tightening or knotting feeling

Stiffness in joints or spine – hard to move, especially upon waking or after sitting

Tenderness or sensitivity to touch or movement – hurts when touched or with movement

Pain when you move – intensifies when you bend, twist, walk, stand, or sit

\[End of sensation list\]

\[There could be confusion if they have 2 conditions and listing all symptoms for both vs listing symptoms for each condition. Maybe we break them down, listing symptoms for each condition? It would be more personal that way.\]

\[If one or two of their conditions are fixable by our process, and one or two of their conditions are disease or pathogen-related, it would be ideal for them to hear about it on this page as well as the good news. Say something like, “\[ \] and \[ \] are good candidates for effectively repairing cellular damage. Unfortunately, \[ \] and \[ \] are not good candidates for our process. These chronic pain conditions are associated with diseases and infections caused by pathogens that are beyond our reach. We apologize for that. But, \[ \] and \[ \] are good candidates. However, we’re not out of the woods... Below is a list of physical pain sensations associated with cellular damage…”\]

\[Elijah, the list above is thorough. I don’t know if that’s a good idea or better to shorten it to keep people moving along. I don’t want people to feel bogged down. The upside of a long list is that prospects feel like they’re represented by all the past things they tried are there. The goal here is to demonstrate later in the Pain Profile why they all failed them. Thoughts?\]

\[Elijah, let’s talk about me adding in a list of meds that my clients need to wean off as we work together. These are not my ideal clients, as it’s a longer process. If I got plenty of clients not using opioids and the like, I could tell those on opioids they’re not qualified. I simply don’t know what I don’t know about getting enough non-opioid clients, or if I need to take them. Thoughts?\]

\[Engaging Question:\] “How urgent is your need to resolve your chronic pain issue?

1\. Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired of your pain and ready to do something now, so long as it promotes good health, has no side effects, is non-invasive, and works?

2\. Frustrated by your pain, but not urgent--now is not the time.

3\. It would be nice to get rid of it, but it’s manageable; you can live with it.”

\[Engaging Question:\] On average, how much do you currently pay out of pocket on your chronic pain every year (deductible, etc.)?

$0-$3000

$3000-$5000

$5000-$10,000

$10,000+

\[Note: If they check “$0-$3000,” The next page says, “If you qualify and you want to work with us, for most clients our process is $3000 for each chronic pain area you want eliminated. Is $3000 affordable to you at this time? Y or N”\]

\[When they click an answer, it takes them to the next page\]

\[Elijah, let’s talk about me adding another question after this money above. I want to ask prospects if they don’t get their pain fixed, do they see themselves paying as much or more in the future as they have in the recent past for chronic pain relief methods and approaches. I want to get them thinking about how their financial headache isn’t going away if they keep doing what they are doing. And I can review their answers in the Discovery call, and it organically brings it up. I want to make the point from their own answer that they will pay for my service either way. The difference is that they will pay more to manage it and keep their pain, or pay less and reduce it permanently, or eliminate it once and for all. I can bring this up either way, but it feels less manipulative if I’m just going over their answers from their assessment. My concern: People may feel it’s too personal to bring up money a second time. Thoughts?\]

\[Elijah, most importantly… Suicide – have they attempted to kill themselves? Have they planned how to kill themselves? Have they had suicidal thoughts/ideation? I can’t help people who answer “yes” to any of those questions. I will have wasted both of our time on the Discovery call. I would really like to add it here to save their time and my time.  
My concern: People may feel that suicide questions are too personal for an assessment. I always ask them on the Discovery call, and they feel fine answering it. I know many people feel free to speak their true thoughts online vs in person, so maybe it’s no big deal. Thoughts? \]

First, a quick question…

**Curious Why Pain Relief Methods and Approaches Have Failed to Fix Your Pain?**

**We Now Know Why**

Your Personalized Breakdown (based on your checked treatments).

For each treatment you tried that didn’t work as desired:

Chiro:

            	•         	✅ “What it fixed: \[muscle/joint/structure\]”

            	•         	❌ “What it missed: Cellular damage in your Primary Cell”

            	•         	📊 “Result: Temporary relief then pain returned”

Physical Therapy:

            	•         	✅ “What it fixed: \[muscle/joint/structure\]”

            	•         	❌ “What it missed: Cellular damage in your Primary Cell”

            	•         	📊 “Result: Temporary relief then pain returned”

Surgery:

            	•         	✅ “What it fixed: \[muscle/joint/structure\]”

            	•         	❌ “What it missed: Cellular damage in your Primary Cell”

            	•         	📊 “Result: Temporary relief then pain returned”

Acupuncture:

            	•         	✅ “What it fixed: \[muscle/joint/structure\]”

            	•         	❌ “What it missed: Cellular damage in your Primary Cell”

            	•         	📊 “Result: Temporary relief then pain returned”

**In Summary…**

Pain medication masks your pain signals. And traditional medicine and alternative approaches treat symptoms, not cellular causes.

None of these approaches repairs the cellular damage in the Primary Cell, so your cells keep recreating your pain pattern.

That's why you can have “successful" surgery but still hurt.

That's why you've tried "everything”, but nothing lasts.

Because the cellular damage was never addressed.

\***NOTE:** Currently, no service, product, therapy, or treatment on the market focuses on the Primary Cell to eliminate cellular damage.

Now for the good stuff…

**Here’s how we address these pain sensations at the cellular level to free you of your pain**

\[Button says\] (Next Page)

Our process targets and repairs the specific damaged genetic material inside your Primary Cell using gentle, non-invasive techniques.

When we fix this genetic material inside your Primary Cell, the pain sensations are released and leave, and this repair automatically echoes out to every relevant cell in your body.

**Real Results From Real People:**

**Chad's Picture:** *5 years of degenerative bone-on-bone pain that ruled his life. Doctors offered only expensive injections and eventual spinal fusion surgery once his vertebrae became brittle enough. We eliminated his pain completely in just 5 sessions. He's been 100% pain-free since December 18th, 2024\. You can watch his case study—from his initial skepticism about our methods to the moment his last pain symptom disappeared in session 5\.*  

**How Do We Do It  –  What’s our Process?**

\[Button says\] (Next Page)

\=== \=== 

\[Next page\]

We don't manage your pain—we eliminate it by repairing the cellular source.

**How We Do It:**

We've identified 9 different types of cellular damage that cause chronic pain. Each requires a specific repair technique. Using your pain signals as a roadmap, we:

1. **Pinpoint the exact cellular damage** causing your specific pain symptoms  
2. **Identify which of the 9 damage types** are affecting you  
3. **Apply the corresponding repair technique** over Zoom to fix the damaged genetic material  
4. **Verify the repair** by monitoring your pain signals in real-time over Zoom

Our techniques work at the cellular level to repair stuck mRNA and damaged histone coatings.

The process feels calm and relaxing—similar to guided meditation—but you're actually performing biological repair work.

**(Important)** The cellular repair approach is brand new to most people, but the science is solid and peer-reviewed.

We're not doing experimental work—we're applying established research about cellular memory storage to solve chronic pain.
